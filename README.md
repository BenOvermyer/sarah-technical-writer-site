# Sarah Overmyer – Technical Writer

Minimal static website for Sarah Overmyer, a technical writer offering contract services.

## How to use

This site consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`). Simply edit it to update content as needed.

## Deploying to Netlify

1. [Sign up for Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) if you don’t have an account.
2. Click “Add new site” and choose “Import an existing project.”
3. Connect your GitHub account and select this repository.
4. For a static site with only `index.html`, Netlify will auto-detect the build settings. You can leave all fields blank except “Publish directory” (use `/`).
5. Click “Deploy site.”

That’s it! Your site will be live on a Netlify URL. You can add a custom domain in Netlify’s settings.
